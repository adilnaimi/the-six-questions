# Implementation Tips

## How Stored?

The medium that you pick should be available for review to both
manager and employee.

A Google Doc shared between you and your report accomplishes this
well.

In theory, you could use paper to capture information, but you'll have
to store it securely.

## Who captures content?

The manager does all of the administrative work.

## Who determines content that's captured?

What's being written should be plain, understandable, and agreed to by
both manager and employee. Specific wording won't be controversial if
you both agree on the big idea behind an answer to a quesetion.

## How much time?

Spend at least 30 minutes going through questions. If you run long and
have to cut it short, schedule a follow-up soon after and next time
schedule 45 minutes.

Avoid spending more than 45 minutes-- each person should come with
ideas to discuss in advance and the focus should be on determining a
plan for the month ahead and going forward.
