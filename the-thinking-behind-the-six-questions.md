# The Thinking Behind The 6 Questions

The six questions create:

1. A self review
2. A manager review (of an employee)
3. Upward feedback (to the manager)

The monthly cadence causes these "reviews" to not be too far apart and
consequently not too big.

The terms "one thing" or "one way" appear in each of the questions. The intent
is to focus on a single thing. This narrows conversation so as to be relevant
and not to overload.

Each area of feedback includes a positive question and a question that may
reveal an opportunity for improvement. This is true for both employee and
manager feedback.

When you use this approach, you should start out tackling simpler issues and
grow gradually.

Meetings where you ask these six questions should **not** be emotionally tense,
and should instead provide clarity that, as a manager, you:

1. Are committed to getting and giving feedback on a regular basis
2. Give feedback that is "not all good" and "not all bad"
3. Believe that regular feedback can assure someone about your appreciation for
   what they are doing right while eliminating surprising or abrupt
   converations.
4. Will give feedback in a way that is clear (eg: the fourth question is
   **the** question where you will ask an employee to change or grow) and
   balanced.

Many companies will also run reviews that happen every 3, 6, or 12 months. This
approach can lay the groundwork for "rolling up" each time you ask the six
questions into the bigger review.
